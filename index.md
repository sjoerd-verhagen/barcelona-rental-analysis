# üèôÔ∏è Barcelona Rental Market Analysis

**Author:** Sjoerd Verhagen  
**Tools used:** SQL ‚Ä¢ Python ‚Ä¢ Tableau  
**Live Tableau dashboard:** [View Here](https://public.tableau.com/views/YOUR-DASHBOARD-LINK)
**GOAL:** Practising my new data skills and building a portfolio to show it!

---

## TL;DR 

Scraped 2,218 Barcelona rental listings from Idealista, cleaned and analysed them with Python + SQL, mapped them with Open Geo Code, and built an interactive Tableau dashboard.

**Goal:**
Find the best-value districts, see where supply is highest, compare average sizes and rents, and figure out the price jump from one- to two-bedroom flats.

## üéØ Background & Project

My girlfriend and I are moving to Barcelona in September 2025. I saw an opportunity to make our house hunt double as a data project, using my Python, SQL and Tableau skills to explore the city‚Äôs rental market.

I scraped 2,218 listings from Idealista, Barcelona‚Äôs most popular housing platform, focusing on furnished flats under ‚Ç¨2,000 a month ‚Äî realistic for our starter budget and ideal since we‚Äôre not bringing furniture from the UK or the Netherlands. The dataset included price, size, location and number of bedrooms.

The goal? To pinpoint which neighbourhoods fit our needs, get a feel for the city, and see which areas offer the best options for our move.

---

## üîç Key Questions

With the data in hand, I set out to answer some practical questions (the kind that actually matter when you‚Äôre moving somewhere new):

- Which districts offer the best value for money (‚Ç¨/m¬≤)?
- Which districts have the largest rental supply?
- What are the average sizes and rents by district?

And because we want space for friends to visit:
- How much extra does a two-bedroom flat cost compared to a one-bedroom?

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

1. Open Web Scraper for collecting rental data
2. Python for cleaning and preparing the data
3.  Open Geo Code for mapping coordinates (python supported)
4.  SQL for queries and data analysis
5. Tableau for creating clear visual insights and dashboard

## Chapter 1 ‚Äì Cleaning the Raw Data

<details>
  <summary>Step 1 ‚Äì Combining the raw files</summary

For the first step, I used Python to combine all individual CSV files into one dataset. I loaded each file from the project folder, appended them to a list of DataFrames, and then concatenated everything into a single DataFrame. I saved this as a new CSV file and quickly explored its structure to check that everything had loaded correctly.

```python
import os
import pandas as pd

folder_path = "/Users/sjoerdv/Documents/PERSOONLIJK/Portfolio/Data 27 jul"
csv_files = [f for f in os.listdir(folder_path) if f.endswith(".csv")]
df_list = []

# Loop through and read each file
for file in csv_files:
    file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file)
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    df_list.append(df)

# Combine all dataframes
combined_df = pd.concat(df_list, ignore_index=True)

# Save to new CSV
output_file = os.path.join(folder_path, "all_rent_data.csv")
combined_df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)

print(f"Combined {len(csv_files)} files into: {output_file}")

# Load the new combined file
df = pd.read_csv(output_file)

# Show shape
print("\nSHAPE of dataset:", df.shape)

# Show columns
print("\nCOLUMNS:")
print(df.columns.tolist())

# Show index
print("\nINDEX:")
print(df.index)

# Numeric stats
print("\nDESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS (numerical):")
print(df.describe())

# Non-numeric stats
print("\nDESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS (non-numerical):")
print(df.describe(include=['object']))

# Preview first 5 rows
print("\nFIRST 5 ROWS:")
print(df.head())
```

</details> <details> <summary>Step 2 ‚Äì Cleaning up key columns</summary>


In this step, I cleaned the price, size, and price-per-m¬≤ columns. The raw data included symbols like ‚Äú‚Ç¨‚Äù and ‚Äúm¬≤‚Äù. I stripped those out so the values are now usable as proper numbers.
- Converted price to price_clean, containing just the amount as a float.
- Did the same for price_per_m2 and size, which now have clean numerical values in new columns.
- Finally, I checked for missing values in those cleaned columns.



```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
file_path = "/Users/sjoerdv/Documents/PERSOONLIJK/Portfolio/Data 27 jul/all_rent_data.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Clean 'price' (e.g. "1,100 ‚Ç¨/month" ‚Üí 1100.0)
df['price_clean'] = df['price'].str.replace(r'[^\d,]', '', regex=True)\
                                .str.replace(',', '')\
                                .astype(float)

# Clean 'price_per_m2' (e.g. "73.33 ‚Ç¨/m¬≤" ‚Üí 73.33)
df['price_per_m2_clean'] = df['price_per_m2'].str.replace(r'[^\d.,]', '', regex=True)\
                                             .str.replace(',', '')\
                                             .astype(float)

# Clean 'size' (e.g. "15 m¬≤" ‚Üí 15.0)
df['size_clean'] = df['size'].str.replace(r'[^\d.,]', '', regex=True)\
                              .str.replace(',', '')\
                              .astype(float)

# Preview cleaned values
print("\nCleaned values:")
print(df[['price', 'price_clean', 'price_per_m2', 'price_per_m2_clean', 'size', 'size_clean']].head(10))

# Count non-missing values in each cleaned column
print("\nNon-missing values:")
print("price_clean:         ", df['price_clean'].notna().sum())
print("price_per_m2_clean:  ", df['price_per_m2_clean'].notna().sum())
print("size_clean:          ", df['size_clean'].notna().sum())
```

</details> <details>
  <summary>Step 3 ‚Äì Further cleaning</summary


For step 3, I extracted and cleaned the number of bedrooms from the listing text, creating a numeric column for analysis.


```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
file_path = "/Users/sjoerdv/Documents/PERSOONLIJK/Portfolio/Data 27 jul/all_rent_data_cleaned.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Extract number of bedrooms (e.g. "2 bed." ‚Üí 2.0)
df['bedrooms_clean'] = df['bedrooms'].str.extract(r'(\d+)').astype(float)

# Preview cleaned results
print("Bedrooms cleaned preview:")
print(df[['bedrooms', 'bedrooms_clean']].head(10))

# Show descriptive statistics
print("Descriptive statistics for bedrooms:")
print(df['bedrooms_clean'].describe())

# Save the updated file
output_path = "/Users/sjoerdv/Documents/PERSOONLIJK/Portfolio/Data 27 jul/all_rent_data_cleaned_v2.csv"
df.to_csv(output_path, index=False)

print(f"File saved with cleaned bedrooms column: {output_path}")

</details> <details> <summary> Step 4 ‚Äì GeoData</summary>

In this step i added the latitude and longitude for every apartment, through GeoData I can automate this process. By fillin gin the API and adding everything I made into geodata that I could later load into Tableau to make a visual representation of the barcelona map.

```python
import pandas as pd
from opencage.geocoder import OpenCageGeocode
import time
from tqdm import tqdm  # progress bar

# API key
key = '0a2df27082034108b046e61491ef609d'
geocoder = OpenCageGeocode(key)

# Load cleaned CSV
file_path = "/Users/sjoerdv/Documents/PERSOONLIJK/Portfolio/Data 27 jul/all_rent_data_cleaned_v3.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Create address query (Street + Subdistrict + District + Barcelona, Spain)
def build_query(row):
    parts = [row['street_cleaned'], row['subdistrict'], row['district'], 'Barcelona, Spain']
    return ', '.join([p for p in parts if pd.notna(p)])

df['full_address'] = df.apply(build_query, axis=1)

# Geocode function
def geocode_address(query):
    try:
        results = geocoder.geocode(query)
        if results and len(results):
            lat = results[0]['geometry']['lat']
            lng = results[0]['geometry']['lng']
            country_code = results[0]['components'].get('country_code', '')
            timezone = results[0]['annotations']['timezone']['name']
            return pd.Series([lat, lng, country_code, timezone])
        else:
            return pd.Series([None, None, None, None])
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error geocoding {query}: {e}")
        return pd.Series([None, None, None, None])

# Apply geocoding with progress bar (and respect free tier: 1 request/sec)
tqdm.pandas()
df[['latitude', 'longitude', 'country_code', 'timezone']] = df['full_address'].progress_apply(lambda x: geocode_address(x))
    # Pause between requests to respect API rate limit
    # time.sleep(1)  # Uncomment if needed for free tier limit

# Save results
output_path = "/Users/sjoerdv/Documents/PERSOONLIJK/Portfolio/Data 27 jul/all_rent_data_geocoded.csv"
df.to_csv(output_path, index=False)
print(f"\n‚úÖ Geocoded file saved to: {output_path}")
```
</details>


## Chapter 2 ‚Äì Data Analysis (SQL)

<details>
  <summary>Step 2.1 ‚Äì bladibla</summary

In this step, I calculated the number of listings, average, minimum, maximum, and price variation for rentals in each district, then ranked districts by average price.

```sql
SELECT 
  district, 
  COUNT(*) AS number_of_listings,
  ROUND(AVG(price_clean),2) AS avg_price,
  MIN(price_clean) AS min_price,
  MAX(price_clean) AS max_price,
  ROUND(STDDEV_SAMP(price_clean),2) AS stddev_price
FROM table_v4
GROUP BY district
ORDER BY avg_price DESC;
```

Let us take a look at the table:

| "district"            | "number_of_listings" | "avg_price" | "min_price" | "max_price" | "stddev_price" |
|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| "Sant Mart√≠"          | 134                  | 1627.01     | 650         | 2000        | 320.09         |
| "Eixample"            | 434                  | 1611.85     | 750         | 2000        | 293.27         |
| "Sant Andreu"         | 34                   | 1596.03     | 990         | 2000        | 357.77         |
| "Les Corts"           | 66                   | 1591.97     | 850         | 2000        | 295.73         |
| "Gr√†cia"              | 199                  | 1543.67     | 800         | 2000        | 306.06         |
| "Sarri√†-Sant Gervasi" | 200                  | 1523.50     | 865         | 2000        | 244.91         |
| "Nou Barris"          | 17                   | 1479.12     | 850         | 2000        | 344.61         |
| "Sants-Montju√Øc"      | 200                  | 1441.33     | 945         | 2000        | 244.22         |
| "Ciutat Vella"        | 846                  | 1339.66     | 700         | 2000        | 303.65         |
| "Horta Guinard√≥"      | 88                   | 1299.02     | 750         | 1995        | 284.45         |

I observed that _Nou Barris_ and _Sant Andreu_ have very few listings compared to other districts. Given that exploratory analysis typically requires a minimum sample size of around 30 to be statistically meaningful, I will exclude these two districts in later steps. 

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 2.2 ‚Äì Which districts give the best value for money (‚Ç¨/m¬≤)? </summary

In this step, I calculated how rental prices per square metre vary across districts (excluding _Sant Andreu_ and _Nou Barris_), by counting listings and finding the average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of price per m¬≤. Then I ordered the districts from cheapest to most expensive per square metre.

```sql
SELECT 
  district,
  COUNT(*) AS number_of_listings,
  ROUND(AVG(price_per_m2_clean),2) AS avg_price_per_m2,
  MIN(price_per_m2_clean) AS min_price_per_m2,
  MAX(price_per_m2_clean) AS max_price_per_m2,
  ROUND(STDDEV_SAMP(price_per_m2_clean),2) AS stddev_price_per_m2
FROM table_v4
WHERE district NOT IN ('Sant Andreu', 'Nou Barris') 
GROUP BY district
ORDER BY avg_price_per_m2 ASC; 
```

In this table:

| district            | number_of_listings | avg_price_per_m2 | min_price_per_m2 | max_price_per_m2 | stddev_price_per_m2 |
|---------------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Horta Guinard√≥      |                 88 |            20.19 |             12.5 |            35.83 |                5.68 |
| Les Corts           |                 66 |            22.92 |            13.33 |               50 |                6.06 |
| Gr√†cia              |                199 |            25.04 |            13.33 |               40 |                5.28 |
| Sants-Montju√Øc      |                200 |            25.55 |            14.09 |               54 |                6.07 |
| Sant Mart√≠          |                134 |            25.84 |             7.14 |            58.33 |                6.56 |
| Sarri√†-Sant Gervasi |                200 |            26.06 |             11.5 |            56.67 |                7.05 |
| Eixample            |                434 |            26.15 |            10.83 |            61.67 |                6.84 |
| Ciutat Vella        |                846 |            27.09 |            11.24 |               95 |                8.64 |

_Horta Guinard√≥_ and _Les Corts_ give the best average price per m2, with a similar st dev compared to the other neighbourhoods. The average price is quie a bit lower then the other neighbourhoods, with a similar stdev.

<details>
  <summary>Step 2.3 ‚Äì Where is the largest rental supply? (with what variance?) (‚Ç¨/m¬≤)? </summary

Here introducing the SQL

```sql
SELECT 
  district,
  COUNT(*) AS number_of_listings,
  ROUND(VAR_SAMP(price_clean),2) AS price_variance,
  ROUND(STDDEV_SAMP(price_clean),1) AS price_stddev
FROM table_v4
WHERE district NOT IN ('Sant Andreu', 'Nou Barris')
GROUP BY district
ORDER BY price_stddev DESC;
```

| district            | number_of_listings | price_variance | price_stddev |
|---------------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Ciutat Vella        |                846 |       92201.29 |        303.6 |
| Eixample            |                434 |        86004.7 |        293.3 |
| Sarri√†-Sant Gervasi |                200 |       59978.54 |        244.9 |
| Sants-Montju√Øc      |                200 |       59644.13 |        244.2 |

The biggest rental supply is in **Ciuttat Vella**, Followed by **Exiample**. We see here that the standard deviation of the price is also the lowest in **Sarri√†-Sant Gervasi** and **Sants-Montju√Ø**, which have the third and forth most listings available. Even thought they had greater average pricesthen **Les Corts** and **Guinardo**. The biggest variance is in **Sant Marti**.

  <summary>Step 2.5 ‚Äì How much more do two-bedroom flats cost compared to one-bedroom flats? (per district) </summary
                                                                                                              
This query compares average rents for 1- and 2-bedroom apartments across Barcelona districts, excluding Sant Andreu and Nou Barris. It uses a CTE and a self-join to calculate both the absolute and percentage rent difference between the two apartment types. The output reveals how much more expensive 2-bedrooms are per district, offering clear insight into local rental pricing dynamics.

You see here that the lowest change is in Les Corts, followed by Sants-Montju√Øc. Interestingly, in Sants-Montju√Øc has the single lowest change for a second bedroom, and it has the top 3 lowest average rent costs as well. Where for Cuitat Vella en Horta Guinardo, the difference between one and two bedrooms was the biggest, even though they were the ones with the lowest rent. Could it be that it is skewed because there are way more 1 bedroom listings?

  <summary>Step 2.6 ‚Äì Lets dive a bit deeper (per district) </summary

This query compares average rents for 1- and 2-bedroom apartments per district, excluding two districts. It calculates both the absolute and percentage price difference using a self-join on a grouped subquery. The result highlights how much more expensive 2-bedroom apartments are, giving further insight into rental pricing by district.

```sql
WITH rent_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        district,
        bedrooms_cleaned,
        COUNT(*) AS listings_count,
        ROUND(AVG(price_clean), 2) AS avg_rent
    FROM table_v4
    WHERE bedrooms_cleaned IN (1, 2)
      AND district NOT IN ('Sant Andreu', 'Nou Barris')
    GROUP BY district, bedrooms_cleaned
)
SELECT 
    r1.district,
    r1.listings_count AS one_bed_count,
    r2.listings_count AS two_bed_count,
    ROUND(r1.avg_rent, 2) AS avg_rent_1b,
    ROUND(r2.avg_rent, 2) AS avg_rent_2b,
    ROUND(r2.avg_rent - r1.avg_rent, 2) AS price_diff,
    ROUND(((r2.avg_rent - r1.avg_rent) / r1.avg_rent) * 100, 2) AS pct_diff
FROM rent_counts r1
JOIN rent_counts r2
  ON r1.district = r2.district
WHERE r1.bedrooms_cleaned = 1
  AND r2.bedrooms_cleaned = 2
ORDER BY pct_diff ASC;
```

| district            | one_bed_count | two_bed_count | avg_rent_1b | avg_rent_2b | price_diff | pct_diff |

| Les Corts           |            10 |            23 |      1519.1 |     1581.52 |      62.42 |     4.11 |
| Sants-Montju√Øc      |            69 |            73 |     1375.14 |     1480.11 |     104.97 |     7.63 |
| Sarri√†-Sant Gervasi |            78 |            64 |     1447.13 |     1580.06 |     132.93 |     9.19 |

| Gr√†cia              |            50 |            85 |     1409.24 |     1616.06 |     206.82 |    14.68 |
| Sant Mart√≠          |            30 |            68 |        1489 |     1717.57 |     228.57 |    15.35 |
| Ciutat Vella        |           371 |           286 |     1234.53 |        1474 |     239.47 |     19.4 |
| Horta Guinard√≥      |            15 |            31 |     1096.87 |     1359.35 |     262.48 |    23.93 |

As we see here is that indeed Horta Guinardo has the lowest number of listings, followed by Les Corts. Interesting, Cuitat Vella had the most listings. Here it seems that for bigger apartments with 2 bedrooms **Sants-Montju√Øc** seems to be a good fit, as it has a good number of listings, a low average rent (top3), for a 1 bedroom apartment, and a low average rent for a 2 bedroom apartment (3rd place).

## What I learned (and Challenges I faced)

<details>
  <summary>Step 2.1 ‚Äì bladibla</summary

- the Idealista site is very well guarded for scraping, so I really had to puzzle with the scraper before I found a way of doing it and it not taking hours to do so. (it still did, as I had to make it into batches of 3 pages (where there were 60+ pages to scrape)
- The Adresses where written in such a way (I think because of the catalan) that it was not very clearly picked up by the GeoData. When I cut out the subdistrict it did work out, this meant I had to change some coordinates by hand
- idealista pages are not always completely filled out, which made the number of bedrooms section get mixed with the #floor section. This meant I first had loads of building which 8 bedrooms, which didn't seem feasable.
